# Changelog

Every change to this fork gets its own version and its own entry here, newest first. The rules:

- One change per version. The version is bumped with `python3 maintenance/tools/bump_version.py X.Y.Z`, which moves
  `pyproject.toml`, `src/decompnet/__init__.py` and `uv.lock` together.
- Headings are exactly `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (the 0.10.6 anchor at the bottom says `upstream` instead of a
  date, because upstream's release date isn't recorded in the code). `maintenance/tests/test_maint_release_hygiene.py`
  fails if the newest heading is not the current version, or if the three version places disagree.
- Each entry says what changed, why, how it was verified, and anything a user must do.
- Entries are tagged **Security**, **Fix**, **Test**, **Docs**, **Tooling**, **Dependencies** or **CI**.

Versions continue upstream's 0.10.x line as plain increments: `updates.version_key` compares only the first three
numbers, so a suffix such as `-fork.1` would be ignored.

## [0.10.7] - 2026-10-21

**Docs, Tooling, Test.** No change to the application's behavior.

- Added the `maintenance/` folder, the one place for everything generated while maintaining this fork:
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, this changelog, `baseline/`, `tools/`, `tests/`
  and `patches/`. A one-line root `CLAUDE.md` points into it so Claude Code finds the instructions.
- **Phase 0 baseline recorded** in `maintenance/baseline/` (raw pytest output, JUnit files, a classified summary and
  a script to rebuild the test environment). Result on a fresh checkout: 107 passed, 3 failed, 20 errors, 139 skipped.
  With the free toolchains installed: 218 passed, 1 failed, 50 skipped. Every failure is explained there; the
  causes are fixed in the entries above this one as they land.
- Added `maintenance/tools/bump_version.py` (bumps the three version places together and refuses if they already
  disagree) and `maintenance/tools/summarize_junit.py` (turns a JUnit file into the test-to-requirement table).
- Added `maintenance/tests/test_maint_release_hygiene.py` (version agreement, changelog discipline, and the bump
  tool's refusal cases). `pyproject.toml` now lists `maintenance/tests` in pytest's `testpaths`.
- Updated the handoff documents with what running the code showed. `ARCHITECTURE.md`: the test count is 246
  functions / 269 collected items in 38 files, and section 10 now separates what was read from what was verified by
  running (findings 8 to 12) and lists what is still open. `MAINTENANCE_PLAN.md`: Phase 0 step 3 now names every
  prerequisite that proved necessary (`llvm-objcopy`, `m2c`, the zlib download), which the original omitted.

## [0.10.6] - upstream

Upstream's last release (decomp.wtf by sam wolfs, MIT). This repository is that code, untouched, plus the entries
above. The upstream notice says the project is discontinued.
